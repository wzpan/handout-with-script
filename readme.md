Handout-With-Script
============

Handout-With-Script is a LaTeX template for generating a handout with script for
presentation. When you are writing a script, it can automatically insert the
slide you already created in your slides file into your script. This is very
handy for someone that need to practice his/her presentation with script and the
slides at the same time.
